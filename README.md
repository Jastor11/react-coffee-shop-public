# React Apps for High Schoolers

This repository serves as the finished product for the Build a Coffee Shop with React series made for my high school students.

The video tutorials can be found here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLJm7_t7JnSjloyIDhWJsUSrCfmxD4OLME

This series of videos walks anyone through the modern process of building a React app from scratch using c9.io and create-react-app.

During a Saturday session at school, I recorded lessons given to a few of my AP computer science students and added them to this playlist for future reference.

Though this series only covers the basics of React, the app is fully functional and will introduce anyone proficient in JavaScript to the core concepts of React.

Let me know if you have any inquiries or questions about this app.
